        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza-ghetti is a combination of two foods, 
            Pizza and Spaghetti (or Pasta). This idea originated in Quebec Canada. 
            The original Pizza-ghetti consists of a slice of pizza 
            and a serving of pasta served on the same dish side by side. 
            This dish spread rapidly to the US and became as one.</p>
